# Qrcode_generator

Project 1: Basic QR Code Generator (QrCode.py)

Description:
This project is a simple Python script that generates a standard QR code using the qrcode library. The QR code contains a link to the YouTube channel @utswarg and is saved as a PNG image. It demonstrates how to use the make() function from the qrcode module to quickly create scannable QR codes for any URL, text, or data input.

Key Features:
Minimal and beginner-friendly code,
Generates a black-and-white QR code,
Saves output as an image (Uts_Youtube.png),
Great for learning the basics of QR code generation.





Project 2: Customized QR Code Generator (Customized_Qr.py)

Description:
This Python project extends the basic QR code generator by customizing the design and configuration of the QR code. Using the qrcode library along with Pillow (PIL), it allows setting the error correction level, adjusting the size and border, and applying custom colors to the QR code. The resulting QR code encodes the same YouTube channel link but with a red foreground and blue background.

Key Features:
High error correction (H) for more reliable scanning,
Custom box size and border thickness,
Colored QR code using fill_color and back_color,
Output image (Uts_Yt.png) with enhanced visual appeal,
Useful for branded or themed QR code generation.
